# Memo North Star Metric (NSM)

## Recommendation
**Weekly Active Journalers (WAJ)**

Definition:
- A user counts as WAJ in a given week if they complete **≥3 “meaningful journal actions”**.

Meaningful journal actions (v1):
- Create a new entry (any length)
- Add an attachment to an entry
- Add/update mood for an entry
- Add/update tags for an entry
- Complete a guided reflection prompt (if/when shipped)

Rationale:
- Captures *habit formation*, not just traffic.
- Robust to “empty opens” and vanity pageviews.
- Comparable to Moodiary’s retention drivers (trail map, attachments, AI reflections).

## Supporting metrics (to manage the funnel)

### Activation
- **TTFE** (time-to-first-entry)
- % of signups who create an entry within 10 minutes

### Retention
- WAJ (NSM)
- W1/W4 retention (cohort)

### Depth / quality
- Entries per WAJ per week
- Attachment rate (WAJs who attach ≥1 media/week)
- Map feature usage (WAJs who open map/week)

### Reliability (critical for journals)
- Sync success rate (background + manual)
- Conflict rate + conflict resolution success
- Export success rate

## “NSM guardrails”
- Do not optimize WAJ by spam prompts or notifications.
- Only count actions that move users toward “I captured something meaningful.”
