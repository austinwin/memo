# Developer standup

- Implementing Flutter pivot (mobile-first, keep repo) per Director.
- Done now: installed Flutter via Homebrew and scaffolded Flutter app at `apps/mobile` (iOS/Android/Web targets).
- Resolved initial dependency conflicts and confirmed `flutter test` passes.
- Next: define core domain model (Entry, Tag, Mood, Location), pick local DB (Drift vs Isar), implement first screens: entries list + entry detail editor.
