# Flutter-first positioning asset: privacy-first diary across devices (Memo)

**Target:** X + Reddit + landing page
**Angle:** Mobile-first Flutter diary that feels fast, private, and trustworthy — built to beat Moodiary on polish.

## One-liner
**Memo is the beautiful, privacy-first diary that’s fast on mobile — and will follow you across devices.**

## What we’re building (Phase 1)
- **Mobile-first Flutter app** (iOS/Android), with desktop/web next.
- **Offline-first** journaling (local DB) so you can write anywhere.
- **Polish-first UX**: calm UI, zero friction, no clutter.

## Why we beat Moodiary (without dunking)
Moodiary is powerful. Memo wins by being:
- **Faster to use daily** (open → write → done)
- **Cleaner UI** (less mode switching, better defaults)
- **Trustable** (clear backup/export story; sync later when ready)

## Key proof points (what to say today)
- Flutter mobile app scaffold is live in the repo (`apps/mobile`).
- Local persistence is implemented (Drift/SQLite) with entry CRUD flow.
- Calendar MVP is in progress (Moodiary-style “return path”).

## CTA ideas
- “Follow the build: we’re shipping to main daily.”
- “Want early TestFlight / Android beta? Reply ‘beta’.”

## Short X post draft
Building a **Flutter-first, privacy-first diary**.

Moodiary has tons of features — we’re beating it by making journaling feel *instant*:
open → write → done.

Offline-first. Clean UI. Backup you can trust.

Want early beta? Reply “beta”.

## Reddit post draft (r/Journaling / r/privacy)
I keep quitting journaling apps because they feel heavy.

So I’m building Memo: a **Flutter-first, offline-first diary** that’s optimized for daily writing.
- fast capture
- calm UI
- privacy by default

We’re benchmarking against Moodiary and trying to beat it on the basics + polish.

Question: what features *actually* keep you journaling—calendar view, media gallery, streaks, or something else?
