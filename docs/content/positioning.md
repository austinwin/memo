# memo — Phase 1 Positioning (PWA web-first SaaS)

## Positioning one-liner (primary)
**memo is the offline-first journal that feels instant like a notes app—now with optional sync + backup you can actually trust.**

## Alternates (for A/B tests)
1. **A minimalist, privacy-first journal that works offline—and syncs when you want it to.**
2. **Journaling without the bloat: fast capture, clean timeline, optional secure sync.**
3. **The “just write” diary: offline by default, organized by time + place, backed up when you opt in.**

## What we’re explicitly optimizing for (vs Moodiary)
- **PWA-first speed**: time-to-first-entry under 60 seconds.
- **Modern UI polish**: fewer screens, consistent components, delightful ergonomics.
- **Trust**: export anytime + transparent sync/backup (optional, not required).

## Key benefits (Phase 1 language)
- **Frictionless daily journaling:** open → write → done. No setup tax.
- **Privacy by default:** offline-first; cloud features are opt-in.
- **Reliable cross-device continuity:** simple sync + backup that doesn’t feel risky.

## Anti-positioning (what we’re *not*)
- Not a “Swiss Army knife” diary.
- Not a social feed.
- Not “hand your journal to an AI by default.”
