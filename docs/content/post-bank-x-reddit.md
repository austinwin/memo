## 1) “Swiss Army knife vs sharp pencil”
**Hook:** Some journaling apps try to be everything. That’s why you stop using them.
- memo is the sharp pencil: open → write → done
- offline-first by default
- optional sync/backup when you’re ready
**CTA:** Want a beta link?

## 2) “Offline-first changes habits”
**Hook:** If your journal needs Wi‑Fi, it’s not a habit—it’s a condition.
- offline-first means you can write anywhere
- sync later, quietly
**CTA:** What kills your journaling streak?

## 3) “Trust is a feature”
**Hook:** The #1 feature in a journal app is… trust.
- export anytime
- clear sync status
- backups you control
**CTA:** What would make you trust a journaling SaaS?

## 4) “We’re beating Moodiary by doing less (better)”
**Hook:** Moodiary is powerful. We’re building the alternative: simpler, faster, calmer.
- fewer modes
- cleaner UI
- web-first PWA speed
- parity where it counts (editor/search/attachments/map)
**CTA:** Team ‘minimal’ or team ‘max features’?

## 5) “60-second onboarding”
**Hook:** Our goal: time-to-first-entry under 60 seconds.
- no setup rabbit hole
- no tutorial dungeon
- just write
**CTA:** Want to try the fastest journal flow?

## 6) “Sync that respects privacy”
**Hook:** Sync shouldn’t require handing your life story to a black box.
- offline-first storage
- optional cloud sync + backup
- transparent controls
**CTA:** Would you use sync if it was opt-in + exportable?

## 7) “Map memories (not just entries)”
**Hook:** I don’t want ‘entries.’ I want places I’ve been.
- map view = memories by location
- filter by time/mood/tag
**CTA:** What’s the first place you’d pin in your journal?

## 8) “Search that actually helps”
**Hook:** Your journal is only as good as your ability to find things later.
- full-text search
- highlights + saved filters (coming)
- tags that don’t become a chore
**CTA:** Do you search your journal, or just scroll forever?

## 9) “Attachments without chaos”
**Hook:** Photos are half the memory. But attachments shouldn’t make the app heavy.
- images first
- fast upload + clean layout
- export that includes media (goal)
**CTA:** What attachment type do you use most—photos, audio, or none?

## 10) “Streaks without guilt”
**Hook:** Streaks should feel like encouragement, not shame.
- celebrate consistency
- gentle reminders
- weekly recap cards
**CTA:** Do streaks motivate you—or stress you out?

## Bonus: 3 Reddit-first post angles (longer form)
1) **“I’m building a journaling PWA because I kept quitting journaling apps.”** Share story + ask what features matter.
2) **“Privacy-first journaling SaaS: what would earn your trust?”** Discuss export, encryption, transparency.
3) **“Minimal journaling prompts that don’t feel cringe.”** Provide a free prompt pack and invite feedback.
